## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge was the most easy for me because I was practice very hard so I can do this challenge very faster.

## My process

I spent 1 hour in this challenge so I didn't a lot of things, I use flexbox for center the container and the perfil photo, the HTML is divided in 3 sections and the CSS is well documented.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I will continue to practice in my knowledge about flexbox and responsive design.
